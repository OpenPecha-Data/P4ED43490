Through the power of this, may we attain buddhahood,
bé dang tsolwa mepé trinlé kyi
And through our enlightened activity, without effort or exertion,
kham sum khorwé gyatso tong gyur té
Empty the ocean of saṃsāra’s three realms,
kün kyang dorjé dzinpé sa tob shok
So that all attain the state of the omniscient Vajradhara.

nekab su ang lek jé chok di tü
Also, here and now, by the power of this supreme undertaking,
gyalkham küntu né muk truktsö mé
May all the world be free from sickness, famine, conflict and unrest,
charchu dü beb lo chuk taktu lek
May the rains fall on time, harvests be bountiful and resources thrive,
ngön tö yönten chok gi jor gyur chik
And may we be rich with the supreme qualities of the higher realms!

ten chok didak gang gi tongwa dang
May anyone who sees these supreme representations of the enlightened ones,
tö dang dren dang chakchö kurti gyi
Hears of them, thinks of them, prostrates before them, makes offerings to them or shows them
respect,
tana lung tsam gyi rek drowa kün
And even those who are merely touched by the same breath of wind,
nekab tartuk dön nyi lhündrub shok
Spontaneously accomplish all their aims, both relative and ultimate!

di shyeng tsé na lü ngak yi sum gyi
May the seed of liberation be planted within the minds
drelwa tokpé ta chuk düdro yen
Of all who were involved in the building of this temple,
shyorla shiwé sokchak tramo tsün
With body, speech or mind—including horses and other beasts of burden,
kün kyang tarpé sabön teb gyur chik
And even the tiniest insects whose lives were taken accidentally.

tsuklakhang ni chö shyin lek drubpé
May this temple provide the conditions for effortlessly mastering
labpé né kün bemé lob kyen shying
Every branch of learning, perfectly and in accordance with the Dharma,
drubpé lé kün tokpa mepar drub
And may every project undertaken here be accomplished without hindrance,
choktün ngödrub pal lo da gyur chik
So that all may enjoy the glory of the supreme and ordinary siddhis!

chö dang zangzing longchö gyaché shying
May Dharma resources and material necessities always be plentiful,
dalwé ten chok lekpar tso nüpé
Enabling all who live here to maintain the supreme support of leisure,
ta nyi pangpé zegö né mal la
Find food, clothing and accommodation, while avoiding the two extremes,1
ten né tarlam changchub drub gyur chik
And, by following the path of liberation, attain enlightenment!

düpé dé kün tö sam gom sum gyi
May the noble conduct of all who gather here—the practices of study, contemplation and meditation—
dzé zang yar ngö da tar gongpel né
Forever flourish and increase just like the waxing moon,
gyalwa gyepé lam chok si tar yang
And may this supreme of paths delighting all the buddhas remain until the very end of time,
mi nyam shé dang drubpé dzin gyur chik
Without ever diminishing, maintained always through study and through practice.

ten la gawé karchok lha kün dang
May all the positive forces and deities who delight in the teachings,
tuchen damchen drekpé tsok nam kyi
And all the powerful and haughty spirits who are bound by sacred oath,
taktu yelmé meltsé lek sung shying
Guard and watch over this temple, without ever becoming inattentive,
pünsum tsokpé pal kün dü gyur chik
And may they gather and attract all manner of glory in abundance.

ten la dang dang tendzin la khu dang
May their sharp and wrathful activity be brought to bear directly upon
gendün düpé shyal du duwé go
All who are hostile to the Dharma or seek to bring ruin upon its holders,
ku dang trokpé ma rung lechen la
And who all who would steal or plunder the resources,
ngönchö möpé nowal bar gyur chik
Which have been donated to the saṅgha community.

tartuk karnak lé kyi dreltsé kün
Ultimately, may anyone who makes a connection with this temple, whether by positive or negative
actions,
yangdak tarpé lam gyi nö gyur né
Become receptive to the pure approach that leads to liberation,
kün kyang tek sum lam gyi ngejung la
And, by following the paths of the three yānas, find true freedom,
ten né khorwé gyatso tong gyur chik
So that the vast ocean of saṃsāric existence is forever emptied!

di na shedrub gyalten né shyindu
For as long as study and practice continue and the buddhist teachings remain here,
tensung tsok kyi meltsé yel gyur na
Should the guardians of the Dharma ever neglect their duties or relax their guard,
gyalwé ka dang dorjé dam galwé
Transgressing the commands of the victorious ones and their own vajra oaths,
kaché drek dé nying la babpar ngé
May the sternest punishment be sure to fall upon those who display such arrogance.

dé lema za dor sok sungmé tsok
From this day on, may Ekajaṭī, Za Rāhula, Damchen Dorje Lekpa and the rest
jinyé tsuklakhang dir tak shyuk né
Abide forever within this temple,
lek pel nyé kyob gal jé cham la pob
Increasing all that is positive, guarding against inauspiciousness, eliminating all obstructions,
trinlé nowal tral du ngönsum dzö
And swiftly and directly bringing to bear the full force of their activity!

These few words of aspiration, to be recited at the end of the register detailing donations
made towards the construction of a great temple, were written by Patrul in Shri Singha, the
hermitage belonging to the monastic centre of the three yānas. May it be virtuous and auspicious!
